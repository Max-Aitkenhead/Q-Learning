<b>Q-Learning Implementation in Java</b>
<p>The project is a proof of concept for shallow Q-Learning and shows how it is very similar to how a real mouse would learn a 2D maze environment</p>
<p>The code is a bit of a mess (as I was myself in my final year) and is only up for archival purposes.  However it is still a fully functional demonstration of Q-Learning and also identifies a number of extra heuristic improvments applied by mice in the real world which the base algorithm does not account for by default.</p>
